<!--WE WILL TALK ABOUT POSITION AND LAYOUT AND WE WILL TAlk ABOUT-->
<!--POSITION OF ELEMENTS ON YOUR PAGE-->


<!--ONE -->

<!--we  want to understand how are these elements are layout on this screen-->

<!--Notice the div elements, they take the entire page-->
<!--the span elements takes the width and the height of the content inside them-->

<!--and this is because of the different display properties i have by default on them-->
<!--Now let's check the inspection-->

<!--Display block is basically saying that it will take the entire width of the parent container-->
<!--for example here the body of the container which is the body-->

<!--The div takes the height of its content.-->



<!--THREE-->
<!--span , if you check it on the inspect dev tool you will notice also it is display inline-->

<!--it takes up as much width as the content inside it and it doesn't take the full width of the parent-->
<!--like how the block do -->

<!--the display inline we can't change the width-->
<!--same thing with the height-->

<!--it only takes enough width and height to fit the content and nothing more-->

<!--if you want it to take width and height you will need to use display inline-block-->


<!--FOUR the Buttons also are inline-block-->



<!--FIVE-->

<!--display none -->

<!--when you use it on an element it will pretend that the element doesn't exist-->
<!--it will be like if you come to your html and you deleted your element-->

<!--What we said is the normal document flow-->
<body>

<div class="div-1">I am Div</div>
<span class="span-1">I am Span</span>
<button class="btn-1">I am Button</button>
<span class="span-2">I am another Span</span>
<div class="div-2">I am another Div</div>

</body>
